    "\n",
    "2.  Step Over - Step Over button will execute the next line of code,\n",
    "    similar to the Step In button. However, if the next line of code is\n",
    "    a function call, the Step Over button will “step over” the code in\n",
    "    the function. The function’s code will be executed at full speed,\n",
    "    and the debugger will pause as soon as the function call returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Step out - Step Out button will cause the debugger to execute lines\n",
    "    of code at full speed until it returns from the current function.\n",

    "**10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?**\n",
